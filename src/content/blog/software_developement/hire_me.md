## About Me

As a driven third-year ICT Engineering student at TAMK, I have honed my specialization in software development with a passion for web development. My expertise encompasses full stack web development, agile methodology, testing, designing, and bringing new concepts to life.

Balancing my passion for technology with a focus on personal well-being, I allocate my free time to both physical fitness and staying current with the latest in ICT + entertainment _(Games / Music / TV-Shows)_.

I embrace challenges as opportunities to further my skills as a web developer and approach each new task with motivation and a willingness to learn.

In addition to my technology pursuits, I am also a seasoned music producer with over a decade of experience.

Quality is paramount in my work as a producer, and I take care to double-check every project before release. Through my years in the industry, I have refined my project management skills, honed my creativity, and developed a tenacity for perseverance and commitment. My marketing skills are also well-honed, having taken on most marketing responsibilities myself, as well as collaborating with artists on an international level.

With a flexible schedule for the upcoming spring semester, I am eager to get to work and demonstrate my capabilities.
