I like to build cool stuff. I'm interested in web development and desktop applications.

I'm almost graduated from the TAMK University of Applied Sciences in Tampere, Finland where I'm studying Software Engineering.

In my free time I like to [produce music](https://jemi.so/juhamikaelmusic), play video games, watch movies and series.
