In this task, I had a teamwork project and a free form coding project.

In the team project, our team designed and developed two different virtual simulated environments for the health personnel's / students, where they can practice concentration and pressure tolerance in rescue situations.

In the coding project, I implemented a web-based weather application. As for programming languages I used Javascript / HTML / CSS and the weather data for the application was fetched from the OpenWeatherMap API. The application runs on the Netlify server.
