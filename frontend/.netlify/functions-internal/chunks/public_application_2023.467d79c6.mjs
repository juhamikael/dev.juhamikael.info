const body = "\r\n## About Me\r\n\r\nAs a driven third-year ICT Engineering student at TAMK, I have honed my specialization in software development with a passion for web development. My expertise encompasses full stack web development, agile methodology, testing, designing, and bringing new concepts to life.\r\n\r\nBalancing my passion for technology with a focus on personal well-being, I allocate my free time to both physical fitness and staying current with the latest in ICT + entertainment _(Games / Music / TV-Shows)_.\r\n\r\nI embrace challenges as opportunities to further my skills as a web developer and approach each new task with motivation and a willingness to learn.\r\n\r\n## Music Production\r\n\r\nIn addition to my technology pursuits, I am also a seasoned music producer with over a decade of experience.\r\n\r\nQuality is paramount in my work as a producer, and I take care to double-check every project before release. Through my years in the industry, I have refined my project management skills, honed my creativity, and developed a tenacity for perseverance and commitment. My marketing skills are also well-honed, having taken on most marketing responsibilities myself, as well as collaborating with artists on an international level.\r\n\r\nWith a flexible schedule for the upcoming spring semester, I am eager to get to work and demonstrate my capabilities.\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in my work, please contact me by joining my [Discord](https://discord.gg/cxp7EKw53w) server, use the contact form below, link to my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juha-savikko/) profile, or send me DM on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/juhamikaell).\r\n";
