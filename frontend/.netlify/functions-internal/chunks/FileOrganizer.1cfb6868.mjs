This folder quickly becomes cluttered and challenging to navigate, making it difficult to find the files we need. As the folder grows, it becomes increasingly time-consuming and tedious to organize the files manually.\r\n\r\nThe solution for that is this File Organizer application helps organize files by moving them to folders based on their file extensions. To use the application, you need to have a configuration file named \"file_map-config.json\" that maps file extensions to folder names.\r\n";
