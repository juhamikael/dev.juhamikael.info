I like to build cool stuff. I'm interested in web development and desktop applications, testing and cloud technologies.

I'm third year student at [TAMK University of Applied Sciences](https://www.tuni.fi/en) in Tampere, Finland studying Information Technology where I'm studying Software Engineering.

In my free time I like to [produce music](https://jemi.so/juhamikaelmusic), play video games, watch movies and series.
