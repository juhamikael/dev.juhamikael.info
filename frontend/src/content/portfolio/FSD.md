I was assigned to maintain Python application that was used to efficiently update the XML description files of FSD data in bulk.

As part of my responsibilities, I also developed and implemented various utility software tools to troubleshoot and resolve any challenges that arose during the course of the project. The position entailed a high degree of accountability and attention to detail, as the integrity and accuracy of the data was of critical importance. The role required a steady and diligent approach to ensure all updates were executed correctly and thoroughly.
